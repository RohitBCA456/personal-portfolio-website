          <h3>ROHIT YADAV - BACKEND DEVELOPER</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Rohit Yadav, a backend developer with a passion for building
            robust, scalable, and efficient systems. With a strong foundation in
            backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases like
            MongoDB, I focus on creating solutions that ensure seamless data
            flow and smooth user experiences. My approach to development
            emphasizes clean code, performance optimization, and scalability.
            I'm always learning new tools and techniques to stay ahead in the
            fast-evolving world of backend development and enhance the
            functionality of the systems I work on.

              <h3>BlockChain Certificate</h3>
              <p>
                I received this Certificate of Participation for attending a
                workshop titled "Introduction to Blockchain and Its
                Applications" on October 26, 2024. The event was organized by
                the Centre for Computer Science and Applications, Dibrugarh
                University. It was a great opportunity to deepen my
                understanding of blockchain technology and explore its
                real-world applications. The workshop was coordinated by Dr.
                Ujjal Saikia, chaired by Prof. Tazid Ali, and supported by
                Ankumon Sarmah, President of Anazori.
